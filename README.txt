== Requirements ==
You need python to run the application.

If you don't have python, download Python 2.7 from Python.org
If you're installing on Windows, make sure in the installation process you select "Add Python.exe to PATH", otherwise you have to do that yourself.

You need "pyglet" (an OpenGL wrapping for Python) to run the GUI. If you have python installed, you can get it with:

$ easy_install pyglet

If you don't want to run in GUI, you don't need pyglet.


== Running ==
Use terminal, change directory to the application folder, and then:

$ python main.py 

To run, and:

$ python main.py -h

To see all available options.


== Support ==
